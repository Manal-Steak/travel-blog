                        OH MY GOD! We had been planning our girl's trip since a year or two. 
                        We always had to rain check for some trivial reasons like laziness 
                        assignments. Yes, college is tough. So, after our classes were shifted
                        to online mode and after a year's waiting (i.e. 2020) we finally decided 
                        to go in february, right after mid-semesters before other work starts 
                        piling up. K was hell-bent for going on a trip and because of that we
                        were all on board for it. After jumping from myriad places from mussoorie,
                        to manali to madhya pradesh to almost booking tickets for matheran, we 
                        finally settled for jaisalmer. First, it's an easy ride and second, 
                        we wanted a leisure trip. So rajhasthan kind of fits into our little
                        squres of requirements. So, right after our exams, we left for rajhasthan
                        on 27th february. WE WERE SO EXCITED. OUR FIRST GIRLS TRIP. CAN YOU
                        BELIEVE IT? AFTER ALL THESE YEARS? So kals, k and I left for ahmedabad at 5.
                        While we were leaving, there was still a moon in the sky. Full moon.
                        K had her dslr w her and therefore she was all ready to capture memories.
                        While she was clicking moon's photos, she peeked outside the window just 
                        to get a better view. And she lost her glasses! It was a scene right
                        out of some movie. Kals and I were busy talking with each other and clicking
                        pictures of our own. But the car stopped. And we were all blank, staring 
                        at K and waiting for her parent's reaction. They firstly went out to look 
                        for it. It was a highway so there was no way we could have taken a u-turn.
                        But her mom and k went ahead to look for it ntl. And they found it! W/out
                        any scratch! I WANT THESE GLASSES! We all fell silent for the most of
                        the ride and cut to the airport. We met p there, bid our byes to their
                        parents and were inside. All excited and ready to board the flight.
                        We clicked pictures in the plane because why not. We were given a special
                        pack of snacks because apparantly we had booked it online maybe(?) im not
                        sure. But we felt special. We exited the flight and were met by our driver.
                        Shady guy but acutally turned out to be a very helpful guide during our whole
                        stay. If i were to name the filter for igram for this place then it would
                        be ochre. The whole ride to our hotel was beautiful. We stopped by to
                        click pictures w the sheeps, our driver made us taste this chai which 
                        was amazing. It was sunny but not hot. We reached hotel. We were given
                        a deal by our driver for our safari. We thought of it all to be very
                        shady at first but after talking to our dads, taking a leap of faith into
                        trusting our driver after much scrutiny we said yes to him. After All
                        he was also giving a good discount and he did try to prove himself
                        to be quite trustworthy. Okay, enough about him. So we got all ready for
                        our desert safari. After almost an hour's ride, we reached the sand dunes. 
                        It was beautiful. So bright and in expanse till your eyes can see.
                        We then went for camel safari & jeep safari. We were now all claded in
                        sand and our hair was a nest. But we still managed to look not all bad.
                        Yes, I know, it's important to look pretty. All the fucking time. 
                        We were then told that there was a some kind of desert carnival and
                        that kailash kher was going to show up. So we went ahead and found a cozy
                        spot on one of the sand dunes. Now, the events that followed after werent
                        we expected at all. In the span of an hour, we ate an icecream facing the moon,
                        I lost my phone (found it later tg), we were met by few shady strangers,
                        were catcalled, and were in desperate need to reach the hotel. It was
                        a little too much for me personally, but in retrospect, it wasnt all that
                        scary. So after that it was all fun and pretty. We ate dal batti. Kals
                        tasted it for the first time and she loved it (tg)! We rode back to our
                        hotel after an hour or two. K still had her paper for the psychology
                        to write while I had my presentation for design thinking the next day.
                        So we all bid our goodbyes and went to sleep early. In our cozy little
                        beds, w cozy little lights on.

                            I woke up around 8 for my presentation, which btw went awful but let's
                            not get into that. K had to pull an all nighter for her exam. And P 
                            and Kals were basically having the time of their lives, looking all fine 
                            and dandy. After getting ready, we locked our rooms and went ahead looking
                            forward for a bright day. We visited a lot of places. First we went to
                            Jaisalmer's main attraction, Jaisalmer Fort. It's believed to be one of the
                            very few <i>living forts</i> in ther world, as nearly one fourth of the
                            city's population still resides within fort. The fort's yellow sandstone walls 
                            camouflages the fort in the yellow tawny desert. We then took a pit-stop
                            at a juice centre before visiting Patwa Haveli and Nathmal Ki Haveli which
                            is known for its intricate architecture & ornate carving with beautiful 
                            history. We then rushed to Bada Bagh for the sunset and it was the most 
                            beautiful sunset we had seen. Sun setting on the horizon with orange and red hues 
                            blanketing the sky complimenting the sandstone cenotaphs of sage Vyas. We also
                            met a friendly dog who basically sat with us for the whole time. We watched the sunset
                            while eating lays and surrounded by tranquility. We were done for the day
                            and were famished. So our driver was happy to help us in suggesting
                            restaurants and we diceded on a roadside one. While we placed an order, P got the 
                            news of her neighbour's dog. It was an emotional moment but there's nothing
                            that the food cant fix. We gorged on the local delicacy called kel-sangri
                            ki sabzi and roti. It was a beautiful time and we were ready to call it 
                            a day. After reaching the hotel, K ran to her room to finish her exam while we
                            three sat near the pool, under the moonlight listening to the songs played
                            by some other group. The moonlight reflecting off the pool's surface with
                            atmospheric songs playing on the side, maybe a good way to end the day. 
                            After resting there for few hours, we bid our byes and hit the sack.

                            The day of rest & recreation and getting drunk. The moment we reached the
                            palace, our jaws dropped. Rajhasthan is sure known for its hopitality and 
                            amiable nature of its people but the royalty? no one can live like royals
                            like them. This huge acre of land, made of sandstone and ornamented
                            with Bougainvilleas, looked so beautiful. After a two hour drive from the main
                            city, this view was worth it. Worth our driver's constant speculation for 
                            our choices. So firstly we divided ourselves and went into our respective rooms. 
                            K & P went straight into the pool while kals and me treated ourselves with
                            the body massage. We went into our rooms and slept for an hour or two for 
                            we were on paradise. In the evening we got ready for the dinner where kals had
                            a pretty rough time getting ready. After finally been done with all the grooming
                            we went outside on the terrace to click pictures. The evening view of the palace
                            took our breath away. We just stood their, admiring its beauty, before we turned
                            back to our photo session. We then descended for dinner. There, we were met
                            with the folk singers and a nice table waiting for us. We were served wine and other
                            delicacies and joined the folk singers for a small jugalbandi and then dance.
                            We loved the food, we loved their hospitality and we were drunk. We then retreated
                            to our rooms, got into our cozy wear and danced madly in the room. We shouted, laughed,
                            cried and sang and danced the night away. We then took our pillows and went to the
                            terrace where we talked life and astrology. The moon was shining bright on us
                            and we were in so much in love with the life at the moment. Everything fit perfectly
                            well, we fit perfectly well. We hugged eachother and said our goodbyes.

                            AAAAAAAAAAAh the last day! We slept around 4 so it was impossible for me to wake
                            up in the morning for the palace tour. I met my friends at the breakfast. We had
                            an amazing breakfast and just gorged on it for an hour or two before we went into our rooms
                            to pack our bags. We clicked few photos and reached the airport around 11. 
                            We bid our byes to our driver who was great and talked about the best days of our life
                            during our flight. It was indeed, our best days of our life. Missing it baaadly now. Until later.
